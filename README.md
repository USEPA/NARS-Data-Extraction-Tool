# NARS-Data-Extraction-Tool

Generalized eForms Shiny app to parse data across all NARS surveys

## Description

This project contains R Shiny code for parsing JSON files from mobile apps developed for the National Aquatic Resource Surveys (NARS), which  allows app users to format and keep an initial copy of their data for examination. It requires users to save all of the files from a site visit in a single folder and produces an Excel file with worksheets for each data type or a set of comma-delimited (.csv) files in a .zip file. This app works for data submitted from apps for the National Rivers and Streams Assessment (NRSA), National Lakes Assessment (NLA), National Coastal Condition Assessment (NCCA), National Great Lakes Assessment (NGLA), and National Wetland Condition Assessment (NWCA).
